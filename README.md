# simulatekeypress_gui
## What it does
This program simulates keypresses. The original version was created for [YourWorldOfText.com](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/), which is why it enters every single character individually.
## How to use
### First you need to set some values
* Delay (ms) - this is the time it takes between each character being "typed".
* Simulate 'Return' key at [...] - This is important for simulation of the return key. For example: If '.' is checked, the program will simulate a "return" after every period. This would have the effect that, if used in a chat program, the message would be send at the end of every sentence.
* Text - the text the program will use
* Infinite Loop - ´(removed since 1.3.0.0)´ Normally the simulation will stop after it has reached the end of the text. With this checked it will just loop around and start again, over and over, for ever.
* Random Misspelling - ´(added in 1.3.0.0)´ every character has a 1 in 50 chance of being misspelled if this is checked.
* Time before start - This is (in milliseconds) how long the program will wait until it starts after the start button has been pressed. Set this to however long it will take for you to focus the textbox the text should be written in
### Now you can find your target
You should choose a chatroom or something of that kind that is okay with excessive spam. You select the values and enter the text the way you want them, and then you press start and click in the text box that you want the program to write in. Now you just wait and watch. The Program will stay visible for you to click "stop" anytime.
